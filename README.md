# HASS-WH-Triggers

## Introduction

HASS-WH-Triggers is a [Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) webapp that allows you to store predefined triggers, which can be used to fire [Webhook trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger) based automations in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).  
Authentication is required to access the list of triggers. User registration and login requires a username, password __and__ a device to perform [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) authentication. This could be a Security Key by e.g. [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com) (or other FIDO2 device vendors), Android 7+, [Windows Hello](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-hello) or Appleâ€™s Touch ID (currently only when using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)). iOs devices with version 13+ support hardware tokens as well. More information on WebAuthn can be found [here](https://webauthn.guide/). You can test if your device is WebAuthn compatible at this site: https://webauthn.io/.

## What do I use this for?

The purpose of this tool is to provide external access to specific Home Assistant automations without exposing Home Assistant itself / granting full access to users with less privileges. Currently Home Assistant has no concept of role based access from start to end. So whoever can login into Home Assistant can pretty much control everythig. By limiting the users access to a set of specific automations, you can provide restricted control for 3rd parties.  
Example: You have an automated door lock and want to grant access to your home to a sibling. You however don't want them to control anything else. Hence you (currently) can't solve this problem by adding a dedicated user in Home Assistant. There are solutions to this problem with a varying degree of usability, effort to set up, and most importantly: __security__.  
This webapp solves the problem by only providing predefined triggers (buttons) for webhook-based automations in a simple user interface. So in the example from above your sibling would only see the button _Unlock door_, but besides that have no other control over your environment.

## Security

The following steps have been taken to make this tool fairly safe to use:
- A valid username and password are required
- WebAuthn is a strict requirement as well (limiting usage to registered devices)
- Registering a new user requires a manually created registration token
- Clients failing to authenticate / register will be banned after a configurable amount of failed attempts for a configurable amount of time
- No API-level access to Home Assistant is required (only the public, but secret, webhooks are called)
- Triggers can optionally be protected by their individual password / PIN

## How it works

Home Assistant provides [Webhook trigger](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/trigger/#webhook-trigger) to execute automations. These triggers can be fired from the internet without any authentication. By using a cryptic webbhook id it is pretty unlikely an attacker is able to execute the automation by guessing the webhook id.  
This tool leverages those triggers to execute automations _remotely_. Within a trigger you specify the used webhook URI, JSON-data that should be included as a payload, optionally the name of the user that fires the trigger, and also optionally a password that is required to fire the selected trigger. The latter serves to configure multiple triggers, but only allowing certain triggers to be fired if the secret is known to the user.  
Because of the nature of webhook triggers your Home Assistant installation has to be exposed to the internet. Or at least the webhook part of it. You can configure to disable certificate checks when calling the webhooks if you are using self-signed certificates for Home Assistant. WebAuthn (the token-part of the builtin security) does not work without certificates. So however you deploy the app, make sure it can be accessed using an encrypted connection.

## Automation in Home Assistant

This is a minimal automation in Home Assistant (YAML style) that will write a message to the logs at the `warning` level. It includes the trigger data, allowing you to observe what data arrives at Home Assistant after executing the trigger.

```yaml
automation old:
  trigger:
    platform: webhook
    webhook_id: secretwebhookid
  action:
    service: system_log.write
    data_template:
      message: "{{ trigger.json }}"
      level: warning
```

If you add a trigger with the trigger data `{"test": "foo"}` and check the _Include user_ checkbox, the output will look something like this:

```
2020-01-17 22:22:37 WARNING (MainThread) [homeassistant.components.system_log.external] {'test': 'foo', 'user': 'john.doe'}
```
